# Advanced Neural Network (NumPy)

A **from‑scratch neural network implementation in NumPy**, designed for educational clarity and experimentation. It covers feedforward networks, training with backpropagation, and a flexible API for defining custom architectures — without relying on heavy frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Core components implemented manually:** linear layers, activation functions, loss functions, optimizers.
- **Fully vectorized training loop** using NumPy.
- **Customizable architectures:** stack layers to build MLPs of arbitrary depth and width.
- **Multiple activations:** ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax.
- **Losses:** MSE, Cross‑Entropy.
- **Optimizers:** SGD with momentum.
- **Educational focus:** clear code, minimal abstractions, heavy use of comments.

## 🧩 Repository contents
```
advanced_nn_numpy.py   # main module (layers, activations, losses, optimizer, training loop)
```

---

## 🚀 Quick start
```bash
# 1) Create & activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2) Install deps
pip install -U pip
pip install numpy

# 3) Run training demo (inside script)
python advanced_nn_numpy.py
```

This will train a small MLP on a toy dataset (XOR or classification blobs) and print loss per epoch.

---

## 🧪 Python API
```python
import numpy as np
from advanced_nn_numpy import NeuralNetwork, Linear, ReLU, Softmax, CrossEntropyLoss, SGD

# Define network: 2‑layer MLP for classification
model = NeuralNetwork([
    Linear(2, 16),
    ReLU(),
    Linear(16, 2),
    Softmax(),
])

# Loss and optimizer
criterion = CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = SGD(lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)

# Training loop (toy XOR)
X = np.array([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]])
y = np.array([0,1,1,0])

for epoch in range(200):
    logits = model.forward(X)
    loss = criterion.forward(logits, y)
    grad = criterion.backward(logits, y)
    model.backward(grad)
    optimizer.step(model)
    if epoch % 20 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")
```

## 🛠️ Components
- **Layers:** `Linear(in_features, out_features)`
- **Activations:** `ReLU()`, `Sigmoid()`, `Tanh()`, `Softmax()`
- **Losses:** `MSELoss()`, `CrossEntropyLoss()`
- **Optimizers:** `SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.0)`
- **Container:** `NeuralNetwork(layers)` (sequential‑style API)

---

## 📦 Requirements
- Python ≥ 3.8
- `numpy`

**Example `requirements.txt`:**
```
numpy>=1.24
```

## 🧭 Tips
- Keep batch sizes small for toy datasets; large batch support is vectorized but unoptimized.
- Weights are initialized with small Gaussian noise; tune `lr` and `momentum` for stability.
- For classification, prefer `Softmax + CrossEntropyLoss` over Sigmoid + MSE.
- Use this project as a learning scaffold, not for production training.

---

## 🧱 Roadmap (ideas)
- Add more optimizers (Adam, RMSProp).
- Add dropout and batch normalization.
- Add support for saving/loading weights.
- Add visualization utilities (loss curves, decision boundaries).
